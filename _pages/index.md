# EuroGraphics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization

The importance of parallel computing is increasing rapidly with the ubiquitous availability of multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cluster systems. Computationally demanding and data-intensive applications in graphics and visualization are strongly affected by this trend and require novel, efficient parallel solutions. The aim of this symposium is to foster the exchange of experiences and knowledge exploiting and defining new trends in parallel graphics and visualization.
