In both cases, you may *add up to one full page* for references.
Submissions will be handled through the (new) [PCS system](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions) (see details below).

Please submit your paper [here](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions). Follow the link, create a new submission, and select "EuroVis" as *society*, "EGPGV 2018" as both *conference* and track.
