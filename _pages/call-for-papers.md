## -- NEW: Early Submission Deadline for EGPGV (December 6, 2017) --

# Scope

This year, the EuroGraphics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization (EGPGV) will have two review deadlines: early submission and regular submission. 
This page is a call for papers for the early submission deadline. 
An FAQ about early submissions is at the bottom of this page.

The symposium seeks papers on graphics and visualization that involve any type of parallel computing. 
Papers on techniques, data structures, algorithms, systems, and applications are welcomed. 
Parallel computing is broadly defined, including high-performance computing and cloud environments, (multi-) GPU computing and heterogeneous, hybrid architectures, and shared and/or distributed memory architectures.
Further, papers focused on processing very large data sets (either for visualization or graphics) are welcome, even if they do not have a particular focus on parallelism.

Typical symposium topics include:

* Computationally and data intensive rendering
* Scientific visualization (e.g., volume rendering, flow, and tensor visualization)
* Information visualization and visual analytics
* In situ analytics and in situ visualization
* Out-of-core processing of large data sets for visualization or graphics
* Simulations for virtual environments (physics-based animation, collision detection, acoustics)
* Mesh processing, level-of-detail, and geometric methods
* Visual computing (image- and video-based rendering, image processing and exploitation, segmentation)
* Scheduling, memory management, and data coherence
* Parallelization approaches and algorithms, such as MapReduce
* Database-related methods, algorithms or approaches, and query-based visualization
* Advanced hardware for data handling or visualization
* Large and high resolution displays, virtual environments
* Scientific, engineering, and industrial applications
* Data analytics on large scientific data sets

In general, appropriate topics for the symposium fall into one of four categories:
1. parallel graphics,
2. rendering of very large data sets,
3. parallel visualization and analytics, and
4. processing of large data sets for visualization or analytics.

The proceedings of the EuroGraphics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization (EGPGV) will be published in the Eurographics Proceedings Series and in the Eurographics Digital Library. Best papers from the EGPGV symposium will be invited to submit an extended journal version to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.

## Early Submission FAQ

**Q**: What happens if my paper is accepted in the early submission review cycle?
**A**: Your paper will have the exact same status as any paper accepted during the regular submission deadline. It will appear in the proceedings and you will present your paper at EGPGV18. Further, you may place your paper on your website and advertise it as a paper that will appear at EGPGV18.

**Q**: What happens if my paper is not accepted in the early submission review cycle?
**A**: Papers not accepted during the early submission review cycle may be resubmitted as new during the regular review cycles. Authors can indicate to the Chairs whether they would like the same reviewers (effectively treating the initial review as a revision).

**Q**: If I do not submit to the early submission deadline, then can I still submit to the regular submission deadline?
**A**: You can absolutely submit to only the regular submission deadline.

**Q**: What is the timeline for the regular submission deadline?
**A**: We are still in discussions with EuroGraphics with respect to camera-ready deadlines. Traditionally, EGPGV has a submission deadline of late February and a notification of early April. We expect the timeline for the regular submissions to match this traditional schedule.
